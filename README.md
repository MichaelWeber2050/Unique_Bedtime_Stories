Motivation

Bedtime stories are important. A stimulating bedtime story can have a positive lasting effects on a child. Many studies have shown a significant link between children who read or are read to at bedtime with higher literacy rates, better brain development, and positive child-parent relationships.
There is also a proven market for children's books and stories. For example "Go the F--k to Sleep" by Adam Mansbach was the New York Times #1 selling book not just in the children's category but for all books. And for the parents out there tired of reading the same story to their children over and over again night after night *after night after night...*
